### Logo Usage Guidelines

1. **Clear Space**: Always maintain a minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "eye" icon.
2. **Minimum Size**: Do not display the logo smaller than 24px in height for digital applications.
3. **Background**: The logo performs best on dark backgrounds (preferably #030712 or #111827).
4. **Modifications**: Do not rotate, distort, or alter the logo's proportions or colors.
5. **Effects**: The glow effect should only be used in digital applications where animation is supported.

### Guidelines
1. **Quality**: Use high-resolution images only.
2. **Relevance**: Images should directly relate to code review, software development, or engineering collaboration.
3. **Treatment**: Apply a subtle blue overlay (Primary Blue at 10% opacity) to unify imagery when necessary.

## Voice and Tone

### Brand Voice
- **Expert**: Demonstrate deep understanding of software development and code review processes.
- **Helpful**: Focus on solutions and improvements, not just identifying problems.
- **Efficient**: Value the user's time with concise, clear communication.
- **Collaborative**: Emphasize teamwork and shared goals rather than criticism.

### Guidelines
1. **Technical Accuracy**: Always ensure technical claims are accurate and verifiable.
2. **Inclusivity**: Use inclusive language that welcomes all developers regardless of experience level.
3. **Active Voice**: Prefer active voice over passive for more direct, engaging communication.
4. **Jargon**: Use technical terms when appropriate for the audience, but avoid unnecessary jargon.
