## Our Approach

1. **Security-First Design üîí**
   - **Zero Cloud Dependency**: Runs entirely on your infrastructure (on-prem or private cloud) - except for checking for software updates and licence validation
   - **Complete Code Privacy**: Your source code and credentials never leave your environment
   - **Risk Elimination**: Recent breaches of cloud-hosted reviewers show how misconfigurations expose repositories--LiveReview eliminates this by design
   - **Full Control**: Your code stays on your servers, period
2. **Maximum Flexibility** 
   - **Multi-Platform**: Integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket
   - **AI Choice Freedom**: Choose Gemini, OpenAI, or self-hosted Ollama for maximum privacy
   - **Workflow Adaptation**: Adapts to your process instead of forcing change
   - **Custom Support**: Unusual setup? We'll work with you--:w

3. **Transparent Affordability**
   - **Straightforward Pricing**: Significantly lower than comparable hosted tools
   - **Sustainable Model**: Paid software built for long-term reliability
   - **R&D Focus**: Investment goes to product improvements, not marketing hype
   - **Maximum Value**: Every dollar funds engineering excellence

## How is this better than... üÜö

### **vs GitHub Copilot**
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works with GitHub, GitLab, AND Bitbucket (not just GitHub)
- **Self-Hosted Security**: Your code stays private vs cloud-hosted risk
- **AI Choice Freedom**: Pick your AI backend vs locked into one model
- **Cost Control**: You control both costs and quality

### **vs CodeRabbit**  
- **More Affordable**: Significantly lower pricing than CodeRabbit
- **Zero Cloud Risk**: Self-hosted vs recent security breaches in cloud platforms
- **Complete Control**: Your code never leaves your infrastructure
- **Attack Prevention**: Eliminates entire class of cloud-based vulnerabilities

### **vs Building Your Own**
- **Ready Out-of-Box**: Skip months of development time
- **Complex Integration Covered**: Code host APIs, webhooks, dashboards all handled
- **AI Expertise Included**: Advanced prompt engineering and review logic included  
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: No need for ongoing MR/PR handling, user management
- **Focus on Product**: Your team builds features, not infrastructure

## Quick Start

Get LiveReview running in under 5 minutes with our simplified two-mode deployment system:

### Demo Mode (Recommended for First Time) üöÄ

This is the recommended installation method. With this - you can get your first AI code review posted within 5-10 minutes:

```bash
# Quick demo setup (localhost only, no webhooks)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HexmosTech/LiveReview/main/lrops.sh | sudo bash -s -- setup-demo
```

You'll require a Free Licence to get started - follow the guide [here](https://github.com/HexmosTech/LiveReview/wiki/Get-a-LiveReview-Licence) to obtain a Licence.

- **Zero configuration** - just run and go
- **Localhost only** - secure local development
- **Manual triggers** - webhooks disabled for simplicity
- **Perfect for testing** - try LiveReview without any setup
- **Easy upgrade path** - switch to production mode anytime

**Access your demo installation:**

- Web UI: http://localhost:8081/
- API: http://localhost:8888/api

### Production Mode (External Access Ready) üåê

For teams and production deployments with reverse proxy and webhooks follow the [Productionization Guide](https://github.com/HexmosTech/LiveReview/wiki/Productionize-LiveReview)


**Production Mode Features:**

- **External access** - ready for reverse proxy setup
- **Webhooks enabled** - automatic code review triggers
- **SSL/TLS ready** - secure for production use
- **Auto-configuration** - webhook URLs derived automatically

### Two-Mode Deployment System

| Feature           | Demo Mode                       | Production Mode               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Access**        | localhost only                  | External via reverse proxy    |
| **Webhooks**      | Disabled (manual triggers)      | Enabled (automatic triggers)  |
| **Configuration** | Zero config required            | Reverse proxy setup needed    |
| **Perfect for**   | Development, testing, demos     | Teams, production deployments |
| **Upgrade**       | `LIVEREVIEW_REVERSE_PROXY=true` | Ready out of the box          |
