Batches had random inheritance files. Which lead made very unstable recall pattern.\n2. Non Inheritance File was added in batching\nex: If the class do not have inheritance feature it was added to gruop batch. hence, Creating issues with Recall\n3. Prompt was too specific with nestjs project.\n\n\nThis version Fixes\n1. Made sorted batching (to make batching always same not random)\n2. Fixed a bug in group batching  which was adding non inheritance files.\n3. Removal of API example example in prompt.\n4. Made Java framework separate prompt.","draft":false,"head_pipeline_id":11217,"id":1825,"iid":426,"last_edited_at":"2025-08-26 14:04:24 UTC","last_edited_by_id":48,"merge_commit_sha":null,"merge_error":null,"merge_params":{"force_remove_source_branch":"1"},"merge_status":"can_be_merged","merge_user_id":null,"merge_when_pipeline_succeeds":false,"milestone_id":null,"source_branch":"ganesh/repodag-v2","source_project_id":170,"state_id":1,"target_branch":"main","target_project_id":170,"time_estimate":0,"title":"Ganesh/repodag v2","updated_at":"2025-10-12 14:42:57 UTC","updated_by_id":48,"prepared_at":"2025-08-21 16:16:12 UTC","assignee_ids":[],"blocking_discussions_resolved":true,"detailed_merge_status":"mergeable","first_contribution":false,"human_time_change":null,"human_time_estimate":null,"human_total_time_spent":null,"labels":[],"last_commit":{"id":"0d239c1ba1efd69a93e263eaf2b519b2210c19dc","message":"Merge branch 'main' of git.apps.hexmos.com:hexmos/liveapi into ganesh/repodag-v2\n","title":"Merge branch 'main' of git.apps.hexmos.com:hexmos/liveapi into ganesh/repodag-v2","timestamp":"2025-08-28T19:09:57+05:30","url":"https://git.apps.hexmos.com/hexmos/liveapi/-/commit/0d239c1ba1efd69a93e263eaf2b519b2210c19dc","author":{"name":"Ganesh Kumar","email":"ganeshkumar6120@gmail.com"}},"reviewer_ids":[],"source":{"id":170,"name":"LiveAPI","description":null,"web_url":"https://git.apps.hexmos.com/hexmos/liveapi","avatar_url":null,"git_ssh_url":"git@git.apps.hexmos.com:hexmos/liveapi.git","git_http_url":"https://git.apps.hexmos.com/hexmos/liveapi.git","namespace":"Hexmos","visibility_level":0,"path_with_namespace":"hexmos/liveapi","default_branch":"main","ci_config_path":null,"homepage":"https://git.apps.hexmos.com/hexmos/liveapi","url":"git@git.apps.hexmos.com:hexmos/liveapi.git","ssh_url":"git@git.apps.hexmos.com:hexmos/liveapi.git","http_url":"https://git.apps.hexmos.com/hexmos/liveapi.git"},"state":"opened","target":{"id":170,"name":"LiveAPI","description":null,"web_url":"https://git.apps.hexmos.com/hexmos/liveapi","avatar_url":null,"git_ssh_url":"git@git.apps.hexmos.com:hexmos/liveapi.git","git_http_url":"https://git.apps.hexmos.com/hexmos/liveapi.git","namespace":"Hexmos","visibility_level":0,"path_with_namespace":"hexmos/liveapi","default_branch":"main","ci_config_path":null,"homepage":"https://git.apps.hexmos.com/hexmos/liveapi","url":"git@git.apps.hexmos.com:hexmos/liveapi.git","ssh_url":"git@git.apps.hexmos.com:hexmos/liveapi.git","http_url":"https://git.apps.hexmos.com/hexmos/liveapi.git"},"time_change":0,"total_time_spent":0,"url":"https://git.apps.hexmos.com/hexmos/liveapi/-/merge_requests/426","work_in_progress":false}}
