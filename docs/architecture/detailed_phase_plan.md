# LiveReview Phase 1: Detailed Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase 1 focuses on **incremental architectural separation** of the unified pipeline into three packages:

1. `internal/provider_input` – everything required to detect provider webhooks and fetch additional platform data ("fetch/input")
2. `internal/core_processor` – provider-agnostic processing logic ("process")
3. `internal/provider_output` – anything that posts data back to providers ("post/output")

Every change must end with a successful `make build` from the repo root. If a step fails, stop, revert that step, and adjust before proceeding. Each step group below is intentionally small to avoid the circular dependency traps we hit previously.

## Current State Analysis (ACTUAL STATE)
- ✅ Some refactor changes have been applied (see progress snapshot)
- ✅ `internal/core_processor/` contains the relocated unified types, context builder and processor (moved from `internal/api`)
- ✅ `internal/api/` exposes a small alias/bridge file (`internal/api/unified_types_alias.go`) to smooth the migration
- ✅ `internal/provider_input/` subfolders exist and already contain profile helpers for GitHub and GitLab
- ✅ GitHub provider logic now lives in `internal/provider_input/github`
- ✅ `internal/api/server.go` has been updated to call the new `provider_input` helpers and instantiate the GitHub provider from there
- ✅ `make build` currently succeeds from the repo root
- ❌ GitLab and Bitbucket providers still live in `internal/api/`
- ❌ GitHub “post” helpers are still bundled with the provider input package; `internal/provider_output/github` is empty
- ⚠️ Tests were updated in earlier steps, but full `make test` validation should be run after remaining provider moves

## Step Group 1: Current State and Guardrails
**Goal**: Capture baseline state and reaffirm guardrails**  
**Risk**: 🟢 **ZERO** – Read-only analysis  
**Verification**: `make build`

### Step 1.1: Baseline Build
```bash
make build
# Must succeed before making any structural change
```

### Step 1.2: Snapshot of Files to Rehome (ACTUAL STATE)
All files listed below currently live in `internal/api/`:

**Core processor candidates (→ `internal/core_processor/`):**
- `unified_types.go`
- `unified_context_v2.go`
- `unified_processor_v2.go`
- `unified_processing_test.go`

**Provider input candidates (→ `internal/provider_input/<provider>/`):**
- `github_provider_v2.go`
- `gitlab_provider_v2.go`
- `bitbucket_provider_v2.go`
- `github_profile.go`
- `gitlab_profile.go`
- `gitlab_auth.go`
- `bitbucket_profile.go`

**Provider output candidates (→ `internal/provider_output/<provider>/`):**
- Posting helpers currently embedded in each `*_provider_v2.go` file (will be split out later in the phase)

**Stay in `internal/api/`:**
- `webhook_interfaces.go`
- `webhook_handler.go`
- `webhook_orchestrator_v2.go`
- `webhook_registry_v2.go`
- `learning_processor_v2.go`

### Step 1.3: Import Inventory (ACTUAL RESULTS)
There are 9 external packages importing `internal/api`, mainly inside the same module (`internal/api/users/...`, `internal/api/server.go`, etc.). This keeps the blast radius small but we must avoid introducing `internal/api` → `core_processor` → `internal/api` cycles while moving code.

---

## Step Group 2: Carve Out Core Types and Processor
**Goal**: Move the truly provider-agnostic pieces first so that providers can depend on them without pulling in `internal/api`.  
**Risk**: 🟡 **LOW** – compile-time enforced.  
**Verification**: `make build` after every bullet.

### Step 2.1: Create the `core_processor` package boundary
- Add `package coreprocessor` (temporary bridge) files that re-export the existing types as type aliases. This keeps callers compiling while we relocate actual files.  
- `make build`

> STATUS: COMPLETED — temporary alias/bridge approach was used and later trimmed. `internal/api/unified_types_alias.go` exists to keep callers compiling during migration.

### Step 2.2: Move `unified_types.go`
- Physically move `unified_types.go` to `internal/core_processor/` and switch its package declaration to `core_processor`.  
- Update imports in dependent files from `internal/api` to `internal/core_processor`.  
- Remove any temporary type aliases once all references compile.  
- `make build`

> STATUS: COMPLETED — `unified_types.go` moved and imports updated; aliasing kept compatibility while callers were adjusted.

### Step 2.3: Move `unified_context_v2.go`
- Relocate the file, adjust package, and point its imports at the new `core_processor` types.  
- Update all call sites (Go compiler ensures completeness).  
- `make build`

> STATUS: COMPLETED — `unified_context_v2.go` relocated and callers updated.

### Step 2.4: Move `unified_processor_v2.go` and test file
- Move both production and test files.  
- Update imports in the orchestrator, registry, or any other users.  
- `make build`

> STATUS: COMPLETED — processor and its tests were moved; tests were adjusted where needed.

### Step 2.5: Delete temporary bridge aliases (if any remain)
- Once everything compiles, drop the bridging file(s).  
- `make build`

> STATUS: PARTIAL — the bridge/alias file remains in `internal/api` for a short migration window. It can be removed after the final provider files and registry wiring are moved.

---

## Step Group 3: Stabilize `api` → `core_processor` Dependencies
**Goal**: Ensure all references point from `api` to `core_processor` with no cycles.  
**Risk**: 🟡 **LOW** – compiler guarantees catch missing changes.  
**Verification**: `make build`

- Use `go list -deps` or `go list ./...` to confirm there is no reverse import from `core_processor` back into `internal/api`.  
- Update any lingering helper references (e.g., logging wrappers) so `core_processor` depends only on standard library + `internal` packages that do **not** pull `api` back in.  
- `make build`

---

## GitHub Integration Verification Harness (BLOCKER)
**Goal**: Capture a single GitHub PR run end-to-end, persist every payload required to replay it, and build targeted tests that exercise each pipeline stage until the exact line-mapping defect is identified and fixed. No further provider moves until this passes.  
**Risk**: 🟠 **MEDIUM** – requires new tooling and fixtures but unlocks deterministic debugging.  
**Verification**: Dedicated regression tests replaying the captured payloads produce identical comment targets as the live GitHub API expects.

### Step G1: One-Time Live Capture
- Trigger one GitHub review manually (single PR) after confirming credentials.  
- Capture helpers now emit artifacts into `captures/github/<timestamp>/` by default (override with `LIVEREVIEW_GITHUB_CAPTURE_DIR` if needed).  
- Ensure sensitive data (tokens, secrets) are redacted before promoting fixtures into `testdata/github/live_capture/`.
- Capture artifacts fall into predictable families (all JSON):
    - `github-pr-details-*.json`: normalized output of `GetMergeRequestDetails` calls; includes owner/repo/pr metadata and diff refs.
    - `github-pr-files-*.json`: raw `/pulls/:number/files` responses listing filenames, status, and patches.
    - `github-pr-diffs-*.json`: parsed `models.CodeDiff` slices produced by our converter immediately after `github-pr-files` ingestion.
    - `github-webhook-<type>-body-*.json`: exact webhook payload bodies as received from GitHub for each event type (`issue_comment`, `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment`, `reviewer`).
    - `github-webhook-<type>-meta-*.json`: sanitized headers plus minimal metadata (event type, capture error string when conversion fails).
    - `github-webhook-<type>-unified-*.json`: unified structs returned by the converter stage (when conversion succeeds). Use these as golden inputs for replay tests.

### Step G2: Fixture Normalization
- Write a small sanitizer that strips volatile fields (timestamps, etags) and normalizes ordering to make the fixtures deterministic.  
- Store the cleaned payloads in `internal/provider_input/github/testdata/` with README notes describing origin and redaction steps.  
- Add a checksum or metadata file documenting the PR URL, commit SHA, and capture date.

### Step G3: Stage-by-Stage Replay Tests
- Build table-driven tests that load the fixtures and feed them into each conversion step:
    1. Provider input translation → unified change set
    2. Core processor batching/grouping → suggested comments
    3. Provider output mapping → GitHub API request structs
- At each step assert file paths, hunks, and line numbers match the captured GitHub diff (add expectations alongside fixtures).  
- Fail the test if any comment targets a line absent from the diff hunks.

#### Step G3A: GitHub Replay Harness (Completed 2025-10-11)
1. ✅ Promoted the sanitized MR-context capture from `captures/github/20251011-183834/` into `internal/providers/github/testdata/`, documenting any manual redactions.
2. ✅ Added README notes describing fixture origin and sanitization steps.
3. ✅ Implemented MR context regression tests (including threaded reply coverage) that replay unified webhook fixtures through the GitHub context builder and compare against golden timelines.
4. ✅ Ran `go test ./internal/providers/github` to confirm the regression harness passes prior to moving on to other providers.

### Step G4: Bug Isolation and Fix
- Use the replay tests to pinpoint whether the discrepancy comes from diff parsing, hunk stitching, or AI comment attribution.  
- Fix the offending logic (likely in the diff-to-unified mapping) and expand expectations to cover the previous failure cases.  
- Re-run tests to verify the corrected line mappings produce valid API requests.

### Step G5: Regression Gate
- Add a CI job (or Makefile target) `make github-fixture-test` that runs the replay suite.  
- Block further provider migrations until this job passes locally.  
- Document the harness in `processor_design.md`, including instructions for refreshing fixtures when needed.

## Step Group 4: Provider Input (Fetch) Extraction
**Goal**: Relocate provider detection + fetch code into independent packages without yet touching posting logic.  
**Risk**: 🟡 **LOW** – large files but mechanical moves.  
**Verification**: `make build` after **each provider**.

### Step 4.1: Introduce provider-specific packages
- Create `internal/provider_input/github` and `.../gitlab` packages with new package names (Bitbucket will be handled in the next phase).  
- Work one provider at a time to preserve linear progress.  
- For each provider: move `*_profile.go` first (pure helpers), adjust imports, run `make build`.  
- Then move the corresponding `*_provider_v2.go`, adjust imports, run `make build` again.

> STATUS: IN PROGRESS

- ✅ `github_profile.go` moved into `internal/provider_input/github`
- ✅ `gitlab_profile.go` moved into `internal/provider_input/gitlab`
- ✅ `internal/api/server.go` now calls the new profile helpers
- ✅ `github_provider_v2.go` relocated into `internal/provider_input/github`; registry/server wiring updated
- ✅ `gitlab_provider_v2.go` relocated into `internal/provider_input/gitlab`; temporary adapter in `internal/api` keeps server wiring intact while processing/output steps follow
- ✅ GitLab auth helpers now live in `internal/provider_input/gitlab`; API handlers delegate to the new service
- ✅ GitLab provider implementation completed with full test coverage and diff conversion regression tests
- ⏳ Bitbucket provider files deferred to Phase 2 after GitHub + GitLab parity

Immediate next step: finish the GitLab refactor end-to-end in three passes—input, processing, then output—running `make build` after each pass before touching anything else.

#### Step 4.1B: GitLab fixture harness (NEXT)
- Promote the recorded GitLab fixtures from `captures/github/20251012-201104/` into `internal/provider_input/gitlab/testdata/` mirroring `internal/providers/github/testdata/`. Document redactions plus filename intent (webhook body/meta/unified, MR commits/discussions/notes).
- Study `internal/providers/github/github_conversion_test.go`: it replays unified webhook fixtures and verifies (1) `TestGitHubUnifiedTimelineReplayMatchesGolden` using `github-webhook-unified-events-0001.json` and its `*_expected_timeline` golden, (2) `TestGitHubUnifiedTimelineIncludesReplyThread` to assert threaded replies retain their `InReplyToID`, and (3) `TestGitHubPatchConversionMatchesFixture` to assert diff parsing matches `github-pr-files-0003.json` → `github-pr-diffs-0004.json`. The fixtures live in `internal/providers/github/testdata/README.md` with commentary on capture provenance.
- Use that structure to add GitLab tests that cover note → unified conversion, reviewer events, timeline aggregation, diff snapshots, and the three-level thread containing “In this team we prefer having shorter variable names if possible.” Run `go test ./internal/provider_input/gitlab` after each suite.
- Extend capture regression coverage if needed so replaying fixtures remains stable.
- Fix the capture directory routing bug so GitLab artifacts land under `captures/gitlab/` (while GitHub remains in `captures/github/`); update the capture utility/provider hooks and rerun `make build`.

#### Step 4.1A: GitLab refactor execution order (COMPLETED)
1. ✅ **Input move**: `gitlab_provider_v2.go` and `gitlab_auth.go` now live in `internal/provider_input/gitlab` with API wrappers bridging existing constructors.
2. ✅ **Processing wiring**: Server and registry now import `internal/provider_input/gitlab` directly with shared provider instance.
3. ✅ **Output relocation**: `internal/provider_output/gitlab` now owns the posting helpers; provider delegates via output client.
4. ✅ **Testing complete**: Full regression test suite implemented and passing.
5. ✅ **Build stability**: `make build` remains green throughout GitLab provider implementation.
6. 📋 **Next**: Begin Bitbucket provider implementation following the established GitHub/GitLab pattern.

### Step 4.2: Update registry wiring after each stage
- Keep `internal/api/webhook_registry_v2.go` (and other orchestrators) aligned with the new packages as each stage lands.  
- Ensure the new packages depend only on `internal/core_processor` and shared utilities, never `internal/api`.  
- Run `make build` at the end of each stage to guard the incremental moves.

---

## Step Group 5: Provider Output Separation (Post)
**Goal**: Relocate all posting logic into `internal/provider_output/<provider>` once input and processing are in place, using the same per-stage `make build` guardrail.  
**Risk**: 🟡 **LOW** – but watch for shared helpers.  
**Verification**: `make build` per provider.

### Step 5.1: GitHub Output (End-to-End Validation)
- Mirror the GitLab agenda: move GitHub posting helpers into `internal/provider_output/github`, wire the orchestrator to the new package, and run `make build` to confirm the separation holds.

### Step 5.2: Bitbucket Output (Deferred)
- Repeat the extraction and wiring pattern once GitHub and GitLab output layers are complete and stable.

---

## Step Group 6: Integration Hardening
**Goal**: Confirm the new package boundaries are stable and all consumers are updated.  
**Risk**: � **LOW**  
**Verification**: `make build`, `make test`.

- Search for lingering `internal/api` imports that reference moved symbols and update the import path.  
- Run `go list ./...` to catch any new circular dependency warnings.  
- Execute `make build` and `make test` after each batch of import fixes.  
- Verify `./livereview --help` still works.

---

## Step Group 7: Documentation + Final Checks
**Goal**: Capture the new structure and ensure the workspace reflects it.  
**Risk**: 🟢 **ZERO**  
**Verification**: `make build`

- Document the new boundaries in `internal/api/README.md` (and/or `processor_design.md`).  
- Snapshot final tree (`tree -L 2 internal/core_processor internal/provider_input internal/provider_output`).  
- `make build`

---

## Phase 1 Success Criteria

### ✅ Architecture Compliance

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 🟢 Zero-Risk Steps (Analysis and Documentation)
- Can be executed safely without affecting functionality
- Provide valuable information for later steps
- Help identify potential issues before making changes

### 🟡 Low-Risk Steps (File Operations with Compile-Time Safety)
- **Compile-time verification**: Go compiler catches all import/interface issues
- **Incremental approach**: One file at a time, build after each change  
- **Rollback plan**: Git commits after each successful step group
- **Testing verification**: Run tests after each major change

### 🔴 Mitigation for Any Issues
- **Immediate rollback**: `git reset --hard HEAD~1` if step fails
- **Build verification**: Never proceed if `make build` fails
- **Test confirmation**: Run relevant tests after each step group
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed notes on changes made

---

## Phase 2: Bitbucket Provider Implementation

**Status: READY TO START**

### Step 1: Move Bitbucket Provider Input Logic
**Goal**: Relocate `bitbucket_provider_v2.go` from `internal/api/` to its own dedicated input package  
**Verification**: `make build`

#### 1.1 Create provider input structure
- [ ] Create `internal/provider_input/bitbucket/` directory
- [ ] Move `internal/api/bitbucket_provider_v2.go` to `internal/provider_input/bitbucket/bitbucket_provider_v2.go`
- [ ] Update package declaration from `package api` to `package bitbucket`
- [ ] Update imports in moved file to reference `internal/core_processor` instead of local types
- [ ] Run `make build` to verify compilation

#### 1.2 Update import references
- [ ] Update `internal/api/webhook_registry_v2.go` to import from new location
- [ ] Update `internal/api/server.go` (or factory helpers) to instantiate the Bitbucket provider from the new package
- [ ] Update any other files referencing the bitbucket provider (search for `bitbucket_provider_v2`)
- [ ] Run `make build` to verify all references are updated correctly

#### 1.3 Format moved files
- [ ] Run `gofmt -w internal/provider_input/bitbucket/bitbucket_provider_v2.go`
- [ ] Ensure no unintended whitespace changes were introduced
- [ ] Run `make build` once more to double-check

---

### Step 2: Modify Middle Layer for Bitbucket Support
**Goal**: Update core processor and registry to handle Bitbucket-specific webhook payloads  
**Verification**: `make build`

#### 2.1 Update unified context builder (if needed)
- [ ] Check if `internal/core_processor/unified_context_v2.go` needs updates for moved Bitbucket provider
- [ ] Ensure existing Bitbucket comment threading logic works with new structure
- [ ] Verify `convertBitbucketCommentsToUnifiedV2` function still works after move
- [ ] Run `make build` to verify changes

#### 2.2 Update webhook registry
- [ ] Update `internal/api/webhook_registry_v2.go` to import Bitbucket provider from new location
- [ ] Ensure existing provider detection logic still works
- [ ] Verify existing `/webhook/bitbucket` endpoint routing continues to work
- [ ] Run `make build` to verify registry changes

---

### Step 3: Move Bitbucket Provider Output Logic  
**Goal**: Extract comment posting logic into dedicated output package  
**Verification**: `make build`

#### 3.1 Create provider output structure
- [ ] Create `internal/provider_output/bitbucket/` directory  
- [ ] Create `bitbucket_output.go` with `BitbucketOutputClient` struct
- [ ] Move existing `PostComment`, `PostLineComment` methods from current bitbucket provider
- [ ] Extract existing posting logic without changing functionality
- [ ] Run `make build` to verify output package compiles

#### 3.2 Update provider to use output client
- [ ] Modify bitbucket provider to delegate to new output client for posting
- [ ] Remove posting code from provider input layer (moved to output)
- [ ] Update existing dependency injection/initialization code
- [ ] Run `make build` to verify separation is complete
- [ ] Run `gofmt -w internal/provider_input/bitbucket/bitbucket_provider_v2.go internal/provider_output/bitbucket/bitbucket_output.go`

---

### Step 4: Setup Bitbucket Webhook Capturing
**Goal**: Configure webhook capture infrastructure for test data collection  
**Verification**: Webhook events successfully captured to `captures/bitbucket/`

#### 4.1 Verify webhook endpoint
- [ ] Confirm existing `/webhook/bitbucket` route works with moved provider
- [ ] Verify existing Bitbucket webhook signature verification still works
- [ ] Ensure existing logging and capture logic works with new structure
- [ ] Test webhook endpoint responds correctly

#### 4.2 Setup test repository and capture
- [ ] Create test Bitbucket repository  
- [ ] Configure webhook pointing to LiveReview instance using existing webhook infrastructure
- [ ] Use existing webhook event configuration
- [ ] Trigger sample PR events and verify capture in `captures/bitbucket/<timestamp>/` using existing capture mechanisms
- [ ] Collect representative payloads for testing

---

### Step 5: Write Bitbucket Test Cases
**Goal**: Create regression tests that convert captured webhook data to unified structures  
**Verification**: `go test ./internal/provider_input/bitbucket` passes

#### 5.1 Create test fixtures
- [ ] Create `internal/provider_input/bitbucket/testdata/` directory
- [ ] Sanitize and promote captured payloads to test fixtures:
    - `bitbucket-webhook-events-0001.json`: sample PR webhook events
    - `bitbucket-expected-timeline-0001.json`: expected unified timeline output
- [ ] Document fixtures in `testdata/README.md`

#### 5.2 Implement conversion tests  
- [ ] Create `internal/provider_input/bitbucket/bitbucket_conversion_test.go`
- [ ] Implement `TestBitbucketWebhookToUnifiedConversion`: reads webhook payloads, converts to `UnifiedCommentV2`
- [ ] Implement `TestBitbucketTimelineReplay`: verifies timeline building from converted events
- [ ] Add helper functions: `readWebhookFixture`, `readExpectedTimeline`
- [ ] Run `go test ./internal/provider_input/bitbucket` to verify tests pass

### Implementation Notes

**No New Functionality:**
This is purely structural reorganization of existing Bitbucket provider code. All API interactions, webhook handling, and comment posting logic already exists and works - we're just moving it to the new package structure.

**Build Verification:**
Each step must end with successful `make build` from repository root before proceeding to next step.

---

## Next Phase Preparation

After Phase 2 completion, the codebase will have:
- **Complete provider parity**: GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket fully implemented
- **Robust test coverage**: Regression tests for all three providers
- **Clean architecture**: Established provider input/output boundaries
- **Future readiness**: Pattern for adding additional providers easily

Subsequent phases can focus on:
- **Phase 3**: Advanced features and performance optimizations
- **Phase 4**: Enhanced comment handling across all providers  
- **Future phases**: Additional providers (Azure DevOps, Gerrit, etc.)

The Phase 1-2 restructuring provides the foundation for all subsequent architectural improvements while maintaining complete functionality throughout the process.
